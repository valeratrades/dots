## Usage
To edit binds
```bash
,ui
```

Execute the bound actions by simply calling the functions.
Following are my names, but this can be changed in `,ui`
```bash
,h
,t
,n
,s
```

Connect `,c` to the current dir
```bash
,add
```

## Requirements
`alacritty` terminal and `sway` wm.
If not the case, rewrite the `,ui` function in `main.sh`
