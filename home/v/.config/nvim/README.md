All shortcuts are configured with **Semimak** keyboard layout in mind.

I use lazy for plugin manager, but the configurations for plugins are implemented in the old style

Some custom tools the configuration relies on are included in [./help_scripts], and are meant to be compiled manually before being able to call the lua functions relying on them.
