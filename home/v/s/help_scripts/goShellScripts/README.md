## Whitepaper
- [ ] Procedurally generate the aliases for functions defined. Convert PascalCase to snake_case.
- [ ] cli arg for target of procedurally generated aliases.sh

	then in the [./functions.sh] we still have the workflow that recompiles the program on sourcing it, and there it will be clearly visible where the `aliases.sh` is generated, from evocation. And then we explicitly source that generated file from the same [./functions.sh] after.
